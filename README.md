### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Igor Buyanov. I'm an ML Engineer specializing in NLP. Currently, I'm working at MTS AI as Senior Developer in Data Labeling team making the labeling process fast and reliable.
Additionally, I'm a PhD student at FRC CSC RAS. My research goal is to investigate and make methods that would search neighbors fast through the billion scale matrices.

### Notable repos:
- [textfab](https://github.com/Astromis/textfab) - a tiny library that is intended to organize all kinds of preprocessing functions in an understandable conveyor-like structure. The basic idea is to represent all functions as process units with the manager that can guide the text through the user-defined sequence of units. Used in my research.
- [SentenceGraph](https://github.com/Astromis/SentenceGraph) - a simple wrapper on UDPipe parser that allows you to parse text on morphological and syntactical levels representing all sentences as a graph. There are several handy methods for its manipulation.
- [Small Student Science Corpus](https://github.com/Astromis/Small-Student-Science-Corpus) - a text collection from student scientific papers with title, abstract, keywords and paragraph segmentation annotation.
